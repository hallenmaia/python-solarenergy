Asynchronous Python client for [SolarEnergy®](http://www.solarenergy.com.br) inverters.

## About

This package allows you to monitor [SolarEnergy®](http://www.solarenergy.com.br) inverters programmatically:

* Equipment serial, model and general info
* Temperature and inverter health
* Real time power, current and voltage
* Grid power information
* Daily/Total energy summaries
* Network summary

## Install

```bash
pip install pysolarenergy
```

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from pysolarenergy import SolarEnergyInverter


async def main():
    """Show example of connecting to your inverter."""
    async with SolarEnergyInverter(host='192.168.1.22') as inverter:
        info = await inverter.get_info()
        print(info)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
```
